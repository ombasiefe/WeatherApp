🌦️ Weather Forecast Web App
This is my second web project, which utilizes a free weather API to retrieve real-time weather forecast information. The app is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

One of its key features is a custom algorithm that scans for specific weather-related keywords. Based on those keywords, the background image dynamically changes to enhance the overall user experience with a visually responsive interface.
